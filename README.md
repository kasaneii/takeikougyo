## 🚀 The Problem & Solution
**The Problem:** Takei Kougyo is a Japanese company with a unique business model: they provide professional scaffolding and construction services, while also running "Takefornia," a California-style gardening side business. The challenge was to create a cohesive website that represented both the "tough" industrial side and the "relaxed" aesthetic side without confusing the user.

**The Solution:** I designed and developed a dual-identity website. Using a split-brand architecture, I created distinct visual paths for construction and gardening services. This ensures that a client looking for scaffolding feels the company's reliability, while a homeowner looking for landscaping feels the "California style" inspiration.
